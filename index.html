    <p>
        As we write CSS these are the type of questions we should ask ourselves;
           <ul>
            <li>Should we layout the text in single or double format</li>
            <li>Should we use a different font colour for the header</li>
            <li>How should the same content appear on a desktop vs on a mobile phne</li>
           </ul>
    
            All the questions above deal with esthetic and function considerations.
            These are the perspectives of the presentation layer CSS.
            lets consider the types of questions we might ask ourselves as wewrite our HTML.
            <ul>
                <li>Does the order of items within a list natter?Shouldmit be a numbered list?</li>
                <li>Should we wrap a list of links inside a navigation task?</li>
                <li>Is this the most important header in the whole HTML document?</li>
            </ul>
   
            The last few questions deal with structure, hierachy, and meaning. These are the perspectives of the content layer  HTML.
            When we write CSS we focus on aesthetic and function considerations.When we write HTML we focus
            on structure, hierachy and meaning.
